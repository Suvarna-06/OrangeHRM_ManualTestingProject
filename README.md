This is a Manual Testing Training, which explain and apply STLC different stages in a functional testing process, it has been tested My Info submodule so it will be used by end users in Orange HRM application. Decision Table is the Technique used to search the effects of combinations of different inputs in uploading components (Photograph , Attachment).

Really good practise of how using FRS (Functional Requirements Specifications) document in terms of building test scenarios, explaining composition of the Test Plan (as example), creating funtional test cases, executing them and identifying/reporting bugs to be fixed by developer team.

Human Resource ApplicationOrangeHRM Manual Testing Project


Project Overview
This Manual Testing Training provides a hands-on approach to Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) by applying various stages in a functional testing process. The "My Info" submodule in OrangeHRM has been tested to ensure its usability for end users within the system.

A Decision Table technique was utilized to evaluate the effects of multiple input combinations, particularly in uploading components such as Photographs and Attachments.


This project is an excellent practical exercise in working with Functional Requirements Specifications (FRS) to:

✅ Build effective Test Scenarios

✅ Structure a comprehensive Test Plan

✅ Create Functional Test Cases

✅ Execute tests and compare expected vs. actual results

✅ Identify and report defects for the development team
