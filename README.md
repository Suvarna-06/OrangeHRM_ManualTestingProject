Project Overview
This Manual Testing Training provides a hands-on approach to Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) by applying various stages in a functional testing process. The "My Info" submodule in OrangeHRM has been tested to ensure its usability for end users within the system.

A Decision Table technique was utilized to evaluate the effects of multiple input combinations, particularly in uploading components such as Photographs and Attachments.

This project is an excellent practical exercise in working with Functional Requirements Specifications (FRS) to:
✅ Build effective Test Scenarios
✅ Structure a comprehensive Test Plan
✅ Create Functional Test Cases
✅ Execute tests and compare expected vs. actual results
✅ Identify and report defects for the development team
